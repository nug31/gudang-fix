# Frontend Build Files

This directory should contain your frontend build files. You can generate these files by running the build command in your frontend project.

## How to Build

1. Navigate to your frontend project directory
2. Run the build command:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
3. Copy the generated files to this directory

## Important Files

Make sure this directory contains:
- `index.html` (the main HTML file)
- JavaScript and CSS files
- Any other assets (images, fonts, etc.)

## Note

The actual build files are not included in this repository. You need to build them separately and copy them here before deploying.
